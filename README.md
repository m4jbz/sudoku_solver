# Sudoku solver written in C

It's a simple sudoku solver using [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) in C.

## Build and run

You need to modify the <code>board</code> variable inside of the **sudoku_solver.c** file to whatever you want (a 9x9 actual sudoku of course). 
And then do the following:

```bash
make solver
./solver
```
